                <h2>About The Open Championship</h2>
                
                <p>The Open Championship Also known as The Open or British Open is the oldest tournament of the Grand Slam. It’s considered to be the most prestigious as it’s held in the homeland of golf. The Open is determined by British climate and nature. The championship is held on traditional courses with a very hard and demanding surface. They’re situated by the seaside and exposed to wind that very often influences the score of the match. The winner of the British Open receives honorary title: The Champion Golfer of The Year. Clinching the title during The Open held on a Scottish Old Course at St. Andrews which is the oldest golf course in the world is considered the icing on the cake. The first British Open took place in 1860 and was dedicated only to professionals. It was won by Wille Park Sr. who received 25 pounds reward. A year later, the tournament was opened for amateurs. Now, any player with a handicap Index not exceeding 1.5 can take part in the tournament.
