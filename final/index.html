                <h2>Also Known as the Grand Slam</h2>
                <p>
                    The Grand Slam in professional golf is winning all of golf's major championships in the same calendar year. Variations include a Career Grand Slam: winning all of the major tournaments within a player's career and the Tiger Slam: winning four consecutive major titles but not in the same calendar year (named after Tiger Woods, the only player to accomplish the feat).
                    Prior to the creation of the Masters Tournament, the national amateur championships of the U.S. and the UK were considered major championships. During that earlier era, the Grand Slam comprised consecutive victories at the United States Amateur Championship, The Amateur Championship (British Amateur) along with the U.S. Open and the Open Championship. 
                    Only Bobby Jones completed a Grand Slam, in 1930. No man has ever achieved a modern era Grand Slam.

                    <h2>A Little Background on the Professional Golf Association</h2>

                    <p>The PGA TOUR is the worldâ€™s premier membership organization for touring professional golfers. The modern-day PGA TOUR was formed in 1968 when a subset of touring professionals broke away from the PGA of America.  Each PGA TOUR player has earned a position on the priority-ranking system that is used to select full-field open tournaments.  Through the world of golf, the PGA TOUR, backed by its network of volunteers, drives positive impact at unprecedented levels to support and improve local communities. The PGA TOUR and its tournaments have donated more than $3.37 billion to date to support local organizations.
