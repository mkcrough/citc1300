<h2> Running</h2>

<p>Running is a great form of exercise.  I prefer running first thing in the morning and before workouts.  This helps me to wake up and get the day started.  It is great for the heart and cardiovascular system.  It also strengthens your bones and your muscles. Running also helps with endurance for workouts and general body movements in life. Overall, running is a great form of exercise.</p>

<h3>Crossfit</h3>

<p>Crossfit is considered a HITT or high intensity interval training exercise. Unlike running which only requires use of your leg muscles. Crossfit is more of a full body workout which requires short burst of intense movements.  You can work out your arms, core, back and legs during one workout.  Crossfit workouts can typically last anywhere from one to thirty minutes.  Another major difference between running and cossfit is while running is the same motion over and over.  Crossfit workouts and different which helps break up the monotony.  Here are a few crossfit workouts to get you started. </p>
