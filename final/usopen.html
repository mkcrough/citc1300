                <p>U.S. Open
                    Also known as The United States Open Championship, it’s considered to be the most difficult tournament in the world. It’s caused by very difficult conditions in the golf courses that are specifically prepared for the tournament. The surface is uneven, the holes are surrounded by numerous obstacles and the way leading to them is very long and narrow. The player with the lowest total number of strokes is the winner. This is the best paid golf tournament, in 2018 the Total prize pool amounted to 12 mln $. The first U.S. Open was played on October 4, 1895, on course at the Newport Country Club in Newport, Rhode Island. It was a 36-hole competition and was played in a single day. It was won by Horace Rawlins who received 150 $ award. Nowadays, the championship takes place in June and the final is held on the Father’s Day. U.S. Open is dedicated to both amateur and professional golfers with a USGA Handicap Index not exceeding 1.4.
