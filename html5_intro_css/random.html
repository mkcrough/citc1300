        <h2> Acadia National Park</h2>
        <p>Acadia National Park is one of the best parks on the east coast.  To me, one of the best features of the park are the mountains directly next to the ocean.  You also have 45 miles of carriage roads that John D Rockefeller Jr. created and funded.  You can ride horses, bike or walk the carriage roads that wind throughout the park.   Another great feature is the 27 mile Park Loop Rd.  The road allows you to drive around the park and see a lot of popular sites the park has to offer.  This is another park worth visiting.  </p>

    <h3>Highly Recommended Day Hikes - Acadia</h3>

    <img src="images/pexels-photo-2408244.webp" alt="Acadia Hike Picture">
    <p>While Acadia is not as big as Glacier National Park it does offer over 125 miles of hiking trails.  It offers some of the best thrill seeking trails in the U.S.  You have to climb up boulders, ladders and scale its mountains.  People have fallen to their deaths on some of these trails.  If you are scared of heights a couple of these trails are not for you. However, if you are not afraid of heights this is the perfect place and here are a few of my favorite hikes.</p>
